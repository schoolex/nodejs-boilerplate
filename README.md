Clean Architecture for node.js projects

## Folder Structure

```
src
│   main.ts         # Application entry point
└───api             # Express route controllers for all the endpoints of the app
└───config          # Environment variables and configurations
└───loaders         # Split the startup process into modules
└───models          # TypeORM Entities
└───services        # All the business logic is here

```

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up the Development Environment

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
- on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`

### Install

- Install all dependencies with `npm install`

### Running in dev mode

- Run `npm start`
- The server address will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:3000`

### Building the project and run it

- Run `npm build` to generated all JavaScript files from the TypeScript sources.
- the builded app located in `dist`.

# Conventional Commits 1.0.0-beta.4

## Summary

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages.
It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history;
which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.
This convention dovetails with [SemVer](http://semver.org),
by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

---

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```
---

<br />
The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the
consumers of your library:

1. **fix:** a commit of the _type_ `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with [`PATCH`](http://semver.org/#summary) in semantic versioning).
1. **feat:** a commit of the _type_ `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with [`MINOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in semantic versioning).
1. **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has the text `BREAKING CHANGE:` at the beginning of its optional body or footer section introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [`MAJOR`](http://semver.org/#summary) in semantic versioning).
A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any _type_.
1. Others: commit _types_ other than `fix:` and `feat:` are allowed, for example [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) (based on the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)) recommends `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.

We also recommend `improvement` for commits that improve a current implementation without adding a new feature or fixing a bug.
Notice these types are not mandated by the conventional commits specification, and have no implicit effect in semantic versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE).
<br />
A scope may be provided to a commit's type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.

## Examples

### Commit message with description and breaking change in body
```
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
```

### Commit message with optional `!` to draw attention to breaking change
```
chore!: drop Node 6 from testing matrix

BREAKING CHANGE: dropping Node 6 which hits end of life in April
```

### Commit message with no body
```
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
```

### Commit message with scope
```
feat(lang): add polish language
```

### Commit message for a fix using an (optional) issue number.
```
fix: correct minor typos in code

see the issue for details on the typos fixed

closes issue #12
```

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

1. Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, `feat`, `fix`, etc., followed
  by an OPTIONAL scope, and a REQUIRED terminal colon and space.
2. The type `feat` MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.
3. The type `fix` MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.
4. A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a
  section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., `fix(parser):`
5. A description MUST immediately follow the space after the type/scope prefix.
The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., _fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string._
6. A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
7. A footer of one or more lines MAY be provided one blank line after the body. The footer MUST contain meta-information
about the commit, e.g., related pull-requests, reviewers, breaking changes, with one piece of meta-information
per-line.
8. Breaking changes MUST be indicated at the very beginning of the body section, or at the beginning of a line in the footer section. A breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon and a space.
9. A description MUST be provided after the `BREAKING CHANGE: `, describing what has changed about the API, e.g., _BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files._
10. Types other than `feat` and `fix` MAY be used in your commit messages.
11. The units of information that make up conventional commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase.
12. A `!` MAY be appended prior to the `:` in the type/scope prefix, to further draw attention to breaking changes. `BREAKING CHANGE: description` MUST also be included in the body
or footer, along with the `!` in the prefix.

## Why Use Conventional Commits

* Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.
* Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed).
* Communicating the nature of changes to teammates, the public, and other stakeholders.
* Triggering build and publish processes.
* Making it easier for people to contribute to your projects, by allowing them to explore
  a more structured commit history.
